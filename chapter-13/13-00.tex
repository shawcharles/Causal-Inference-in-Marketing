\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter explores why regularisation is needed for panels with many controls relative to sample size, showing how to preserve valid causal inference. We formalise models with high-dimensional controls, dependence structures, and the role of fixed effects and latent factors. You will learn to apply \index{lasso}lasso, \index{elastic net}elastic net, grouped penalties, and data-dependent penalty choice under clustering. We also develop double selection and post-selection inference with cluster-robust uncertainty, integrating regularisation with DiD, event-study, and DML for robust identification. Finally, we specify tuning, diagnostics, and reporting standards suitable for small clusters and serial dependence.
