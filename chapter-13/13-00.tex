\chapter{High-Dimensional Controls and Regularisation}

\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter addresses a pervasive challenge in modern marketing panels: covariate dimensions that rival or exceed sample size. You will learn why regularisation is necessary for valid causal inference in such settings, how to apply \index{lasso}lasso, \index{elastic net}elastic net, and grouped penalties with dependence-adjusted tuning, and how to integrate these tools with difference-in-differences, event-study, and double machine learning designs. We also develop post-selection inference with cluster-robust standard errors and provide diagnostic and reporting standards for panels with few clusters or serial dependence.
