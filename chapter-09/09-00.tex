\chapter{Advanced Matrix Methods for Causal Inference}
\label{ch:advanced-matrix}

\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter extends the matrix completion foundation from Chapter~\ref{ch:factor} to cover advanced methods for complex panel structures. We cover \index{tensor completion}tensor completion for multi-way panels. You will learn when standard matrix completion is insufficient and how to address these limitations. We cover tensor completion for multi-way panels (product by store by time), robust methods for outlier-contaminated data, matrix completion with side information, time-varying rank models for non-stationary environments, and Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification. You will understand the computational trade-offs in large-scale problems and learn to select the appropriate method given your data structure and research question. When factor-based identification is not preferred, see Chapter~\ref{ch:sc} and Chapter~\ref{ch:generalized-sc} for SC and SDID. For event-time plotting and pre-trend diagnostics see Chapter~\ref{ch:event}; for staggered DiD estimands see Chapter~\ref{ch:did}; for design diagnostics and inference see Chapters~\ref{ch:design-diagnostics} and~\ref{ch:inference}. We provide four detailed marketing applications demonstrating these methods in practice.
