\chapter{Advanced Matrix Methods for Causal Inference}
\label{ch:advanced-matrix}

\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter extends the matrix completion foundation from Chapter~\ref{ch:factor} to complex panel structures. You will learn when standard matrix completion is insufficient and how to address its limitations through five extensions: \index{tensor completion}tensor completion for multi-way panels (product $\times$ store $\times$ time), robust methods for outlier-contaminated data, covariate-assisted completion, time-varying rank models for non-stationary environments, and Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification. You will understand the computational trade-offs in large-scale problems and learn to select the appropriate method given your data structure and research question. For alternative identification strategies, see Chapter~\ref{ch:sc} (synthetic control) and Chapter~\ref{ch:generalized-sc} (SDID). For event-time plotting, pre-trend diagnostics, staggered DiD estimands, and inference, see Chapters~\ref{ch:event}--\ref{ch:inference}. Four marketing applications demonstrate these methods in practice.
