\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter develops \index{synthetic control}synthetic control methods for causal inference when a single unit or a small number of units receive treatment. You will learn to construct synthetic controls using donor pools, convex weights, and predictor sets to achieve tight pre-treatment fit. We articulate the identification assumptions underlying synthetic control and relate the method to factor models and potential outcomes frameworks. You will conduct inference using in-space and in-time placebos, RMSPE ratios, and permutation tests. Finally, we apply diagnostics, sensitivity analyses, and extensions to marketing settings with spillovers, anticipation, and missing data.
