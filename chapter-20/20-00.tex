\chapter{Outlook and Open Problems}
\label{ch:outlook}

\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter looks to the future. We articulate a research agenda for panel causal inference in marketing, focusing on the challenges posed by modern digital platforms, privacy constraints, and adaptive systems. We highlight open problems in areas such as large-scale \index{interference}interference, \index{nonstationarity}nonstationarity, and methods for reliable inference, and we propose a practical roadmap for both researchers and practitioners.
