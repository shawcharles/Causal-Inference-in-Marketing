This chapter develops \index{factor model}factor models and \index{matrix completion}matrix completion methods for panel causal inference. You will understand factor models as generative structures for panel outcomes with shared shocks and heterogeneous exposures. We formalise interactive fixed effects (IFE) models, including identification up to rotation and factor number selection. You will learn to apply matrix completion via nuclear-norm regularisation to impute counterfactuals under missing or treated cells. We map connections to synthetic control and SDID, clarifying when factor designs are preferable to parallel-trends designs. When factor-based identification is not preferred, see Chapter~\ref{ch:sc} and Chapter~\ref{ch:generalized-sc} for SC and SDID. For event-time plotting and pre-trend diagnostics see Chapter~\ref{ch:event}; for staggered DiD estimands see Chapter~\ref{ch:did}; for design diagnostics and inference see Chapters~\ref{ch:design-diagnostics} and~\ref{ch:inference}. Finally, you will implement diagnostics, tuning, and inference suitable for marketing panels with serial dependence and limited clusters.
