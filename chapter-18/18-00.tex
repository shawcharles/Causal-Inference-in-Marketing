\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter provides a rigorous engineering handbook for causal inference in marketing. We classify marketing problems along two dimensions: the \emph{identification threat} (confounding, endogeneity, interference) and the \emph{temporal structure} (static or dynamic effects). These dimensions are orthogonal---a problem may exhibit endogeneity \emph{and} dynamics simultaneously---and the analyst must address each appropriately. For each application domain, including \index{advertising}advertising, \index{pricing}pricing, \index{loyalty programme}loyalty, and \index{platform}platforms, we define formal estimands, detail the identification assumptions, and prescribe a diagnostic protocol. We move beyond simple case studies to present end-to-end solution architectures that link business questions to defensible econometric designs.
