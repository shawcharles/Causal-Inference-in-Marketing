\textbf{Charles Shaw} is a Data Science Director at T\&P Group, where he leads econometric measurement and optimization for global brands including Electronic Arts, Toyota, and Amazon. A specialist in causal inference and Bayesian modeling, he focuses on bridging the gap between academic econometrics and the practical realities of marketing data.

His work involves designing advanced measurement frameworks that integrate Market Mix Modeling (MMM) with design-based causal inference, specifically addressing challenges in high-dimensional, privacy-constrained environments. He was the principal architect of a proprietary Bayesian MMM framework now deployed across EMEA, and his research on spatial panel econometrics and "GeoLift" experimentation has been recognized with industry awards from MediaTel and Mediaweek.
