\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter confronts violations of the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) that pervade marketing applications. You will learn to distinguish between \index{spillovers!network}network, \index{spillovers!geographic}geographic, and \index{spillovers!competitive}competitive spillovers, understanding how each propagates through different market structures. We formalise interference using exposure mappings that model how treatment of one unit affects outcomes of others. You will learn to estimate direct and spillover effects under partial interference, applying methods that decompose total effects into within-unit and cross-unit components. We address the challenges of competition and saturation in marketing panels, showing how strategic interactions and market-level effects complicate causal inference. Throughout, we emphasise rigorous identification strategies and diagnostic procedures for detecting and quantifying interference. For event-study and DiD mechanics see Chapters~\ref{ch:event} and~\ref{ch:did}; for design diagnostics and inference see Chapters~\ref{ch:design-diagnostics} and~\ref{ch:inference}; for dynamics under interference see Chapter~\ref{ch:dynamics}.
