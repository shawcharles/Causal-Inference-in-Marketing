\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter develops hybrid methods that blend design-based weighting with outcome modelling. You will learn to formalise augmented synthetic control (ASCM), regularised SC, and synthetic difference-in-differences (SDID). We specify identification assumptions and show how hybrids extend the factor model framework introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:sc}. You will implement tuning, donor curation, diagnostics, and inference for multiple treated units and staggered adoption. Finally, we apply hybrids to marketing settings with short pre-periods, few treated units, and complex data structures.
