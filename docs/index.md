# Causal Inference in Marketing

## Panel Data and Machine Learning Methods

**A rigorous, practitioner-oriented guide to causal inference for marketing analysts and applied econometricians.**

---

### Why This Book?

Marketing measurement is in crisis. Third-party cookies are disappearing. Privacy regulations constrain data access. Platform algorithms confound treatment and outcome. Yet business decisions still require credible causal estimates.

This monograph equips you with the methods to extract causal insights from **panel data**—the customer-week, store-day, and DMA-month structures that define modern marketing analytics. We bridge design-based causal inference with machine learning, covering everything from classic Difference-in-Differences to cutting-edge matrix completion and double machine learning.

### What You'll Learn

- **Design-Based Foundations**: Difference-in-Differences, Event Studies, Synthetic Control—with rigorous identification assumptions and diagnostics.

- **Modern Extensions**: Staggered adoption estimators (Callaway–Sant'Anna, Sun–Abraham), Augmented Synthetic Control, Synthetic DiD.

- **Factor and Matrix Methods**: Interactive Fixed Effects, nuclear-norm matrix completion, tensor methods for multi-way panels.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Double/Debiased ML, causal forests, high-dimensional controls with valid post-selection inference.

- **Marketing Applications**: Advertising effectiveness, pricing, loyalty programmes, platform interference, privacy-preserving measurement.

- **Practical Guidance**: Diagnostics, sensitivity analyses, and a practitioner roadmap for real-world implementation.

### Who Is This For?

- **Marketing data scientists** building measurement systems at scale.
- **Applied econometricians** working with panel data in industry.
- **Academic researchers** seeking rigorous methods for marketing applications.
- **Graduate students** in marketing, economics, or statistics wanting a comprehensive reference.
