## Why This Book?

Marketing measurement is in crisis. Third-party cookies are disappearing. Privacy regulations constrain data access. Platform algorithms confound treatment and outcome. Yet business decisions still require credible causal estimates.

This monograph equips you with the methods to extract causal insights from **panel data**—the customer-week, store-day, and DMA-month structures that define modern marketing analytics. We bridge design-based causal inference with machine learning, covering everything from classic Difference-in-Differences to cutting-edge matrix completion and double machine learning.
