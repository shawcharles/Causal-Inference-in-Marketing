# About the Author

**Charles Shaw** is a researcher and practitioner working at the intersection of causal inference, machine learning, and marketing analytics.

This monograph grew from the observation that marketing analysts face a unique combination of challenges: panel data structures with complex dependence, platform algorithms that confound treatment and outcome, privacy constraints that limit data access, and business stakeholders who need actionable causal estimates—not just predictions.

The goal of this book is to provide a rigorous yet practical guide that bridges the gap between academic econometrics and industry practice.
