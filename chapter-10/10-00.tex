\chapter{Dynamic Treatment Effects}

\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter equips you to understand why marketing interventions generate dynamic treatment paths through anticipation, \index{carryover}carryover, \index{ad-stock}ad-stock, \index{habit formation}habit formation, and \index{decay}decay. You will learn to formalise path-dependent potential outcomes, event-time estimands, impulse responses, long-run multipliers, and half-life metrics.

We show how to apply identification strategies under staggered adoption for dynamic effects, clarifying no-anticipation versus limited anticipation. You will implement heterogeneity-robust event studies, distributed-lag models, and dynamic difference-in-differences for continuous and discrete treatments. Finally, you will conduct diagnostics, inference, and reporting suitable for serial dependence and multiple testing in dynamic profiles.
