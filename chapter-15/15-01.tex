\section{Motivation and Scope}
\label{sec:threats-motivation}

Marketing panels are not created in a vacuum. They are shaped by platform algorithms, privacy policies, and powerful seasonal forces. These features create recurrent threats to the validity of our causal estimates.

A threat to validity is anything that creates bias, inflates our uncertainty, or misaligns our estimand with the question we want to answer. Following the credibility revolution, we advocate for anticipating these threats and integrating diagnostics into our research design from the start.

This chapter maps threats to the assumptions they violate, explains their bias pathways, and presents detection and mitigation strategies that span design choices, estimation adjustments, and sensitivity reporting.

We situate discussion within modern panel frameworks \citet{arkhangelsky2024causal} and draw on identification foundations in Chapter~\ref{ch:frameworks}, diagnostic workflows in Chapter~\ref{ch:design-diagnostics}, and robust inference in Chapter~\ref{ch:inference}.
