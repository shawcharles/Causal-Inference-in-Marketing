\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter catalogues the recurrent threats to valid causal inference in marketing panels. We explain how to detect and mitigate common problems like \index{seasonality}seasonality, platform policy changes, \index{algorithmic confounding}algorithmic confounding, and \index{measurement error}measurement error. We connect these threats to the core assumptions of our models and provide a practical playbook for diagnostics and sensitivity analysis, in line with the design-based principles of this book.
