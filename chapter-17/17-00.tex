\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter establishes a disciplined diagnostic workflow that links design choices to identification, estimation, and inference. We cover: (i) control and donor selection for DiD, event studies, and synthetic control, including factor-space coverage and exposure curation; (ii) \index{overlap}overlap, \index{balance}balance, \index{pre-trends}pre-trends, and \index{placebo test}placebo tests; (iii) influence diagnostics via \index{leave-one-out}leave-one-out analysis, weight dispersion, and perturbation checks; (iv) multiverse and \index{specification curve}specification curve analyses; and (v) sensitivity analyses for parallel trends violations, unobserved confounding, and measurement shifts.
