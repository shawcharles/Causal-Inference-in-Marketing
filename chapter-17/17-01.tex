\section{Motivation and Scope}
\label{sec:diagnostics-motivation}

Credible causal claims rest on good design and rigorous diagnostics. As \citet{angrist2010credibility} emphasise, identification assumptions must be stated clearly, the design must make them plausible, and diagnostics must test them transparently. This chapter provides a unified workflow for doing so, from selecting control groups to assessing the robustness of final estimates.

We assemble a practical playbook applicable across all methods discussed in this book. We emphasise pre-specification, triangulation across methods, and how to proceed when diagnostics reveal problems. This chapter builds on the threats discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:threats} and the inference procedures in Chapter~\ref{ch:inference}.
