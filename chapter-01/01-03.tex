\section{Panel Data in the Marketing Analytics Ecosystem}
\label{sec:marketing-ecosystem}

Marketing organisations measure effectiveness through four broad approaches, each with distinct strengths and limitations.  Understanding where panel methods fit is critical for selecting the appropriate tool.

 Attribution modelling is ubiquitous in digital marketing, but as noted in Section~\ref{sec:measurement-crisis} it remains observational and platform-specific.  It reports which touchpoints precede conversions rather than counterfactuals, and often omits spillovers.  We use it for optimisation, not for causal effects.

 Marketing mix modelling (MMM) can be estimated using aggregate time series or panels that include adstock and saturation.  As discussed earlier, aggregate time-series MMM faces identification and spillover challenges and struggles with discrete interventions.  Panel MMMs are complementary; we are contrasting them with the common aggregate implementation.

 The third pillar, geo-experiments, represents the gold standard of causal inference.  By randomising treatment across geographic markets -- designated market areas, stores, regions -- firms can generate clean variation in marketing actions that is, by design, uncorrelated with potential outcomes.  Geo-experiments are particularly valuable when spillovers are localised within markets (and thus internal to treatment or control clusters) and when the intervention can be implemented at a market level.  Platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon now provide tools for running large-scale geo-experiments, lowering adoption barriers.  Nevertheless, geo-experiments face practical limitations: spillovers across treatment and control geographies can contaminate estimates, small numbers of geographic clusters limit statistical power, short experimental durations may miss long-run effects, and the cost and complexity of implementing randomised rollouts can be prohibitive.

 Panel data methods constitute the fourth pillar.  The modern approaches that are the focus of this book apply quasi-experimental identification strategies to observational data, exploiting natural variation in the timing, location, or intensity of marketing actions to estimate causal effects.  Unlike attribution models, panel methods explicitly model counterfactual outcomes under control conditions while making testable assumptions about the absence of unobserved confounding.  Unlike typical aggregate time-series MMM implementations, panel methods can easily isolate discrete interventions, accommodate staggered adoption, and incorporate unit and time heterogeneity using fixed effects or factor structures.  Unlike geo-experiments, panel methods do not require randomisation, enabling analysis of historical data, long-run effects, and settings where randomisation is infeasible.  In practice, MMM and panel designs often overlap (for example, panel MMM with adstock and saturation fitted under a design-based identification strategy).

Panel causal designs require design-specific assumptions, not a one-size-fits-all condition. Some methods — difference-in-differences, event studies, interactive fixed effects (Chapters~\ref{ch:did}, \ref{ch:event}, \ref{ch:factor}, \ref{ch:advanced-matrix}) — rely on some form of parallel evolution across treated and control units. Others — synthetic control and its variants (Chapters~\ref{ch:sc}, \ref{ch:generalized-sc}) — substitute strong pre-treatment fit for parallel trends assumptions. Still others — instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, dynamic panel GMM — require entirely different identifying structures: relevance and exclusion, continuity at a threshold, or moment conditions with specific serial correlation patterns. Throughout, we signpost assumptions and diagnostics in Chapters~\ref{ch:did}--\ref{ch:spillovers} and \ref{ch:inference}.

How should a practitioner decide which tool to use? The data structure drives the choice. Without repeated observations on the same units over time, panel methods are off the table. When repeated observations exist, randomisation remains the gold standard. Experiments provide clean identification, though panel methods still add value by controlling for pre-treatment imbalances, quantifying heterogeneity, and extending short-term experimental results through longer observational follow-up. 

When randomisation is infeasible, the structure of treatment variation guides method selection. Discrete interventions at specific points in time call for difference-in-differences or synthetic control methods (Chapters \ref{ch:did}, \ref{ch:event}, \ref{ch:sc}, \ref{ch:generalized-sc}). Treatments that vary smoothly over time or across units without clear pre-post divides suit factor models and matrix completion methods (Chapter \ref{ch:factor}). Spillovers and interference demand methods that explicitly model network or geographic linkages (Chapter \ref{ch:spillovers}). High-dimensional covariates or heterogeneous treatment effects benefit from machine learning integration (Chapters \ref{ch:ml-nuisance}, \ref{ch:high-dim}).

Figure \ref{fig:ecosystem} visualises these four pillars and their relationships. The overlapping circles represent not competition but complementarity. Where the circles intersect, we find opportunities for triangulation. Randomised experiments can validate panel-based estimates and calibrate parameters for marketing mix models. Panel methods can extend short-run experimental results to longer horizons and provide causal interpretations of platform attribution metrics. Marketing mix models can guide the selection of channels for deeper causal analysis. Attribution models can inform which customer segments or touchpoints warrant experimental or quasi-experimental scrutiny. At the centre, where all four approaches converge, lies the principle of triangulation: multiple methods, each with different assumptions and limitations, can collectively build a more robust case for causality than any single method in isolation. The figure also highlights the distinct timelines over which each method operates -- experiments measure effects over days or weeks, panel methods track outcomes over months or years, marketing mix models aggregate data across weeks or quarters, and attribution models provide real-time feedback. Understanding these complementarities and trade-offs is essential for building a comprehensive measurement strategy.

MMM and panel methods are not mutually exclusive. Many workflows combine MMM-style transforms (adstock, saturation) with design-based identification in panels (DiD, SC, IV). Panel MMMs are natural when you have multi-market or store-level data, and design-based logic strengthens identification. Factor-augmented panels (Chapters~\ref{ch:factor}, \ref{ch:advanced-matrix}) and instrumental variables (Chapters~\ref{ch:frameworks}, \ref{ch:inference}) further bridge modelling and design.

Today's methods did not emerge completely formed.  They are the result of decades of intellectual development, addressing new data sources, computational capabilities, and substantive challenges.  Figure \ref{fig:timeline} depicts the evolution of panel econometrics from the 1980s and 1990s (dominated by two-way fixed effects and random effects models that controlled for time-invariant unobservables) to the design-based revolution of the 2000s, which brought synthetic control methods and a renewed focus on difference-in-differences with explicit parallel trends assumptions, to the modern era of heterogeneity-robust estimators and machine learning.  Each wave improved on the previous one while also addressing limitations revealed by empirical practice.  Researchers discovered the negative weighting issue in two-way fixed effects regressions with staggered treatment timing in the late 2010s.  This discovery sparked a flurry of new estimators that aggregate cohort-specific treatment effects without relying on previously treated units as implicit controls.  Recognising that parallel trends in levels may be too strong resulted in synthetic control methods based on pre-treatment trajectories.  The proliferation of high-dimensional data, including rich customer covariates, detailed competitor actions, and granular geographic and temporal variation, prompted the incorporation of machine learning tools for flexible control and heterogeneous effect estimation.  This timeline is more than just a historical curiosity.  It demonstrates the iterative, self-correcting nature of methodological progress and reminds us that today's cutting-edge methods will be refined, extended, or replaced as new challenges arise.  The marketing applications that drive this book -- loyalty programs, advertising campaigns, platform expansions -- have played an important role in this evolution, providing both motivation for new methods and an empirical testing ground where their strengths and weaknesses can be identified.

The aims of this book grew out of several converging developments rather than a single influence. A sequence of methodological breakthroughs in causal inference for panel data, together with a rapidly expanding applied literature, has made it possible to study marketing interventions with far greater rigour than traditional time-series or attribution approaches allow. At the same time, much of the marketing analytics discourse has drifted toward predictive machine learning, often with only loose connections to identification and design. This book attempts to recentre the discussion on causal structure and research design, while still drawing on modern tools where they genuinely strengthen empirical work.

Within this landscape, the survey by \citet{arkhangelsky2024causal} provides a technically rigorous synthesis of the modern causal panel data literature, covering assignment mechanisms, estimands, difference-in-differences with heterogeneity, synthetic control methods, factor models, and recent advances in inference. We build on much of the same underlying work, but with a different structure and emphasis. First, we prioritise marketing-specific issues — measurement challenges around attribution and platform metrics, threats to validity from seasonality and algorithmic confounding, and substantive applications in loyalty programmes, advertising, pricing, and channel expansion — that receive limited attention in econometrics or finance texts. Second, we integrate recent developments in machine learning for causal inference — double machine learning, causal forests, high-dimensional variable selection — as supporting tools for credible identification rather than as stand-alone prediction technologies. Third, we adopt a practitioner orientation, emphasising intuition, diagnostics, and method selection guidance over formal proofs, while maintaining technical precision in the assumptions and identification arguments.
