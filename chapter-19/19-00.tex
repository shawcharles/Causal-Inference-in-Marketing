\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter shows how to map platform metrics and data pipelines to econometric estimands transparently, aligning with identification and inference requirements. We specify robust practices for identity linking, keys, joins, deduplication, and time or calendar alignment under \index{privacy}privacy and policy constraints. We diagnose and mitigate \index{attribution}attribution bias, exposure mismeasurement, \index{missing data}missingness, and measurement error, with sensitivity and partial-identification framing. We reconcile data sources and method outputs across designs and document divergences. Finally, we build reproducible, governed pipelines that prevent leakage and support design-faithful diagnostics and inference.
