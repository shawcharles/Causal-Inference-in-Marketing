\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter shows how to map platform metrics and data pipelines to econometric estimands transparently, aligning with identification and inference requirements. Measurement error is not merely a nuisance that inflates standard errors; it can violate the identification assumptions that underpin causal designs, from exclusion restrictions in instrumental variables to parallel trends in difference-in-differences \citep{bound2001measurement}. We specify robust practices for identity linking, keys, joins, deduplication, and time or calendar alignment under \index{privacy}privacy and policy constraints. We diagnose and mitigate \index{attribution}attribution bias, exposure mismeasurement, \index{missing data}missingness, and measurement error, with sensitivity and partial-identification framing. We reconcile data sources and method outputs across designs and document divergences. Finally, we build reproducible, governed pipelines that prevent leakage and support design-faithful diagnostics and inference.
