\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter develops event-study designs\index{event study} for panel data analysis. You will learn to define event-time estimands $\theta_k$ and their aggregation across cohorts and calendar time, specify lead--lag regressions with appropriate normalisation, binning, and window selection, and estimate event-time effects under staggered adoption while avoiding already-treated contamination. You will conduct pre-trend and anticipation diagnostics, choose appropriate inference procedures, and interpret event-study plots for marketing decisions, distinguishing transitory from persistent effects.
