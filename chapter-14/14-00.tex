\chapter{Continuous and Nonlinear Panel Models}
\label{ch:continuous}
\index{continuous treatment|(}

\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter tackles two common realities in marketing data: treatments that are not simply on or off, and outcomes that are not simple continuous variables. We will explore how to handle \index{continuous treatment}continuous or multi-valued treatments like \index{pricing}price changes and advertising budgets, and outcomes like binary choices or event counts. We will formalise \index{dose-response}dose-response functions, develop identification strategies for them, and show how to estimate them using both traditional and machine learning methods. We will also cover nonlinear panel models for discrete or limited outcomes.
