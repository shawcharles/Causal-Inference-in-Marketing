\section{Diagnostics and Design Considerations}
\label{sec:continuous-diagnostics}

Diagnostics for continuous treatments mirror those in Chapter~\ref{ch:design-diagnostics}, but they are adapted for a dose-response setting.

\subsection*{Overlap and Balance}

Plot dose distributions by treatment group and report overlap statistics such as the proportion of observations with GPS values above a minimum threshold. Show covariate balance after any adjustments, using standardised mean differences across dose quantiles.

\subsection*{Sensitivity and Robustness}

Run placebo tests using pre-treatment outcomes or pseudo-treatments. Check the sensitivity of your results to different modelling choices: alternative basis functions, bandwidth selection, and trimming thresholds. Report how estimates change across these specifications to demonstrate robustness.
