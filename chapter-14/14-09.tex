\section{Tuning and Implementation}
\label{sec:continuous-tuning}

Implementing dose-response estimators requires careful choices about basis functions, weighting, and cross-validation design.

\subsection*{Basis and Model Specification}

Basis choice for dose uses splines or series with degrees selected by cross-validation confined to training folds. Interactions between dose and key moderators are allowed parsimoniously to avoid overfit. GPS models can be parametric or ML-based.

\subsection*{Weighting and Trimming}

Stabilised weights improve precision, with careful truncation to cap extremes. Common-support checks guide modest trimming, and sparse tail regions are binned or reported with wider bands.

\subsection*{Cross-Validation Design}

Fold design respects dependence by blocking at the unit or time level, or both when needed. Avoid leakage from post-treatment to pre-treatment periods when training nuisance functions \citet{angrist2010credibility}.
