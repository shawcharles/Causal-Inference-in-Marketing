\chapter{Design-Based Thinking for Panels}
\label{ch:design-overview}

\noindent\textbf{Learning objectives.} This chapter helps you distinguish experimental from quasi-experimental identification in panels, recognise assignment mechanisms that determine credible designs, understand geo-experiments, switchbacks, and phased rollouts at a conceptual level, and know where detailed diagnostics and inference are treated later in the book.
